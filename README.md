MDB_pilot
=========
This repository contains the code of project about autonomous flight of AR.Drone 2 using GPS and Arduino controller.
This repo has 3 folders:
      * Arduino folder contains a arduino scetch.
      * MDBPilot_ARM folder is composed from C program which should be compiled using ARM cross-compiler. Built executable file should be placed in the AR.Drone file system.
      * There is already compiled binary in the ARM_prebuild folder. It can be used as first tests.
Way point coordinates specified in Arduino program.

This Software is ALPHA! Use it at your own risk. Using the binary can cause unstable flights and you have the risks of losing your drone.
