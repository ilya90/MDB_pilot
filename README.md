MDB_pilot
=========
This repository contains the code of project about autonomous flight of AR.Drone 2 using GPS and Arduino controller.
This repo has 3 folders:
      * Arduino folder contains a arduino scetch.
      * MDBPilot_ARM folder is composed from C program which should be compiled using ARM cross-compiler. Built executable file should be placed in the AR.Drone file system.
      * There is already compiled binary in the ARM_prebuild folder. It can be used as first tests.
Way point coordinates specified in Arduino program.

This Software is ALPHA ! It is provided for reference only. Use it at
your own risk. Use of this software may loose you your drone, or put
you in all sorts of touble. Make sure to obey local rules, laws, and regulations
considering air traffic where you fly. I'm telling you to do so now !
